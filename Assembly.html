        <h2>Setting up the Tower</h2>
        <p style="width: 55%">
            This page will walk you through the process of how to set up the tower and prep it for assembly. <br>
            Setting up the tower is a very simple task as there is nothing to install or connect, you're just making <br>
            sure that tower is ready to go, but more importantly, that <b>you</b> are ready to go (i.e. you have all the <br>
            parts, tools, manuals, and resources you need, so you don't have to leave the assembly area to get something). <br>
        </p>
        <ol class="article-list" style="width: 55%">
            <li>To set up the tower, you simply have to make sure that both side panels (if both come off) are taken off <br>
                and the box with all the screws you will need and front panel wires are out of the way. It should look <br>
                something like the image to the right.</li>
            <li>More importantly, you have to make sure you are ready for this task; these are the tasks you should already <br>
                have done and tools you need to have on hand to ensure a smooth assembly:
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure you are in a well lit, and <b>DUST-FREE</b> environment on a hard surface of some kind as to minimize <br>
                        the risk of losing any small screws in the event they are dropped.</li>
                    <li>Make sure you have all the tools you will need on hand, this will vary depending on the components you have <br>
                        so make sure to have read the instruction manuals beforehand, so you know all the tools you will need.</li>
                    <li>Make sure to ground yourself (in general you want to ground yourself everytime before handling a <br>
                        component, as a simple shock is more than enough to fry the components). There are also special bracelets <br>
                        that prevent your body from building a static charge, so it wouldn't hurt to have one of those.</li>
                    <li>Have the manuel for every component on hand, this site is a simple general walkthrough of how to <br>
                        assemble a computer <b>NOT</b> a replacement, especially because installation instructions vary by <br>
                        manufacturer.</li>

        <h2>Installing the Motherboard</h2>
        <p style="width: 55%">
            The goal of this page is to walk you through the process of installing the motherboard. <br>
            To reiterate, this is <b>NOT</b> a replacement for using the manual as the manuals provide <br>
            the specific instructions for your chosen component. It's just meant to lay down a path for <br>
            you to follow, so you have a general idea to where to go; the manuel's are your map so you <br>
            know exactly what you need to do next. <br>
        </p>

        <ol class="article-list">
            <li>Now that you are ready to install the motherboard, first lay the tower on its side, with the open side up. <br>
                Also, from the box of screws that came with the tower, grab all the screws that will be used to anchor the <br>
                the motherboard to the tower. To figure out what screws those are, reference the manual that came with the <br>
                case; it'll have a table in it that lists all the different types of screws, the number you should have <br>
                and what they are used for.</li>

            <li style="position: relative; min-height: 450px">
                Once you have the screws and the case is on its side, locate the holes in the tower that will be how the <br>
                motherboard is anchored to the case.
                <img class="image" src="MotherboardNotInstalled.jpg" alt="A motherboard not in the case with the anchor holes circled" style="width: 400px; height: 400px">
            </li>

            <li style="position: relative; min-height: 450px">
                Now that you've identified the places where the motherboard will anchor to the tower, find the holes in <br>
                motherboard that will align to the holes in the tower.
                <img class="image" src="MotherboardAnchors.jpg" alt="The places where the motherboard will anchor to the tower" style="width: 400px; height: 400px">
            </li>

            <li>Once you find both sets of holes carefully place the motherboard into case making sure the two sets of holes line up <br>
                After the motherboard is in place, anchor the motherboard to the tower by putting a screw in each hole <br>
                and use a screwdriver to tighten the screw <i>take care not to accidentally touch the motherboard with the <br>
                    screwdriver lest you risk damaging the board.</i></li>

            <li>
                Now that the motherboard is in place, we can connect the motherboard to the front panel of the tower using <br>
                using the wires coming from the front panel. Connecting the motherboard to the front panel makes the <br>
                power-on and reset buttons, headphone and microphone jacks, and USB ports on the front panel work. <br>
                To correctly connect the wires, you need to reference the motherboard manuel and look for something like <br>
                the image to the right. After that, it's a simple matching game, the female connectors from the front panel <br>
                are labelled, so put them in the right spot according to the motherboards manual.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Congratulations, you've now successfully installed your motherboard.

        <h2>Installing the CPU</h2>
        <p style="width: 55%">
            The purpose of this page is to walk you through the steps to install your CPU on your motherboard. If at any point <br>
            the steps are not clear enough, and you don't know exactly what to do, <b> consult the manual, DO NOT guess.</b> <br>
            Even though AMD and Intel CPUs have different sockets the process of installing the CPUs is practically the same. <br>
            So, there is no need to have two separate lists. The steps for installing the CPU are as follows: <br>
        </p>

        <ol class="article-list">
            <li style="position: relative; min-height: 450px">
                First you want to take a look at the CPU Socket, you want to look for an arrow in one of the corners that <br>
                looks something like the image to the right. There is a similar arrow on the CPU, and using the the two <br>
                arrows is how you know the correct orientation for the CPU to be in for installation as it matters.
                <img class="image" src="CPU%20Installation.jpg" alt="What you are looking for" style="width: 400px; height: 400px; position: absolute">
            </li>
            <li>
                Next you want to lift-up the latch that is what anchors the CPU into the socket, and if it is an Intel CPU <br>
                lift up the cover as well.
            </li>
            <li style="position: relative; min-height: 450px">
                Lay down the CPU into the socket using the arrows in the corners of the socket and CPU to make sure it is <br>
                aligned correctly. <br>
                <img class="image" src="CPU.jpg" alt="What you are looking for" style="width: 400px; height: 400px; position: absolute">
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally pull down the cover (if an Intel Socket), and pull down the latch until you hear a click.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Congratulations, your CPU is now installed.

        <h2>Installing the GPU</h2>
        <p>
            This article will cover the steps to install the GPU. As always, consult the manual if you don't see the path <br>
            in front of you clearly. The steps to install the GPU are as follows: <br>
        </p>

        <ol class="article-list">
            <li style="position: relative; min-height: 450px">
                First you want to identify the expansion slot that the GPU will go in. As explained in the motherboard section, <br>
                the GPU goes in the expansion slots (also known as the PCI-Express slots). While there are a handful of <br>
                PCI-Express slots, there is only one that the GPU can go in, <b>the PCIe x 16 slot</b>. Which is easily <br>
                identified as the <b>longest</b> expansion slot. Though if you are having trouble determining the right slot <br>
                consult the motherboard manual.
                <img class="image" src="PCIe%20x16%20slot.jpg" alt="A PCIe 16 slot" style="width: 400px; height: 400px; position: absolute">
            </li>
            <li>
                There is a clip on the right side of the PCIe slot which will help hold the GPU in place once installed. <br>
                You want to make sure the clip is in an open state; then you want to line up the GPU to the slot, and then <br>
                apply pressure until you hear a click.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lastly, there is normally a little grove on the back panel of the GPU that matches up with a hole on the <br>
                back of the case. Take the appropriate screw, which you figure out by looking at the towers manual, and <br>
                use a screwdriver to screw the screw into the slot, providing another way to anchor the GPU.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Congratulations, the GPU is now installed.

        <h2>Installing the PSU</h2>
        <p>
            This page will cover the steps to install the PSU; if the steps are never clear make sure to consult your manuals. <br>
            The steps to install the PSU are as follows: <br>
        </p>

        <ol class="article-list">
            <li>First you want to find the big hole in the back of the tower, that is where the PSU will go.</li>

            <li>Then you want to get the PSU into place, making sure the chord that will plug into the wall is facing out. <br>
                There are four more screw holes in the back of the case that line up with holes on the back the PSU. Using <br>
                some screws that came with the case, that is how you will anchor the PSU into place.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Congratulations, your PSU is now installed.

        <h2>Installing the CPU Cooler</h2>
        <p>
            This page will cover the steps to install the CPU Cooler; if the steps are never clear make sure to consult your manuals. <br>
            The first few steps of the walk through will pertain to both because the installation of both is the same until the air cooled <br>
            sink is installed. A liquid cooler takes a few more steps than an air cooler, so there will be a few more steps after the installation <br>
            of the air cooled sink that will be about the liquid cooled sink, don't worry though, the additional steps for the liquid cooler will <br>
            be explicitly stated as steps for the liquid cooler.
            The steps to install the CPU Cooler are as follows: <br>

            <li style="position: relative; min-height: 450px">
                Start off by taking your thermal paste, which will help with heat transfer between the CPU and heat sink, <br>
                and applying a small dot in the center of the CPU. <i>More is not usually better, especially in this case</i>. <br>

            <li>Now you have to assemble and attach to the motherboard the structure that will anchor the cooler in place. <br>
                Typically, coolers nowadays provide the anchors for an Intel socket and an AMD socket, which do differ because <br>
                of the design of the two sockets. For exact instructions, I would confront your manuals, but there are several holes <br>
                in the area of the CPU socket which is where screws will go through to connect the front and back parts of the cooler <br>
                anchor.</li>
            <li>
                Next, place the heat sink on top of the CPU while lining up the screw holes in the coolers anchor and the heat sink. <br>
                Then screw into place, taking care to screw them in tightly, but not <i>too tightly</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The steps after this point will be about the liquid cooler. <br><br>
                Now that the heat sink is in place, there is still a radiator that needs to be installed. <br>
                In most modern computer towers, there is extra space in the top of the tower to accommodate the <br>
                radiator in addition to the fans that go up top. You just need to finesse the radiator into place <br>
                and screw it in with the long screws that came with the tower. <br>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Congratulations, the heat sink in now installed.

        <h2>Installing the RAM</h2>
        <p>
            This page will cover the steps to install the RAM; if the steps are never clear make sure to consult your manuals. <br>
            The steps to install the RAM are as follows: <br>
        </p>
        <ol class="article-list">
            <li>The RAM is one of the easiest components to install, simply find the DIMM slots, which were covered in <br>
                the motherboard section. Make sure the clips at the top and bottom of the slots are in an open state. <br>
                Orient the RAM stick so that the gap in the middle of the card lines up with the spot in the DIMM slot <br>
                Then push the stick in until you hear a click, which is the clips closing, keeping the RAM stick in place. <br>
                Repeat for each RAM stick you have.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Installing the Fans</h2>
        <p>
            This page will cover the steps to install the fans; if the steps are never clear make sure to consult your manuals. <br>
            The steps to install the fans are as follows: <br>
        </p>
        <ol class="article-list">
            <li>
                Most towers, when purchased, include a singular fan with it, so you're going to need 4 additional fans (5 if you <br>
                want to replace the included fan). Three of the fans are for exhaust and two of the fans are for in take. <br>
                The two intake fans go in the front, two of the exhaust fans go up top, and the last exhaust fan is in the back. <br>
                When installing the fans, make sure that the fans will be pushing air in the right direction, something that you <br>
                can determine by looking at the side of the fan.
            </li>
            <li>
                To install the front fans, carefully remove the front panel of the tower to access the area where the fans will go. <br>
                Orient the fans correctly and screw them to the tower using the longs screws that came with the tower. And put the <br>
                front panel back in place.
            </li>
            <li>To install the top fans, the process changes depending on if there is a radiator up there or not. <br>
                If you do have a radiator, just orient the fans below the radiator and screw them into the tower (take <br>
                great caution as it <i>will be a tight squeeze</i>. If there is no radiator, you'll have to remove the top <br>
                panel of the motherboard, slide them into place and screw them into the case.</li>
            <li>The back fan is the easiest; simply line it up and screw it in.</li>
            <li>Lastly, you have to connect the fans to the motherboard; you'll have to reference it's manual to see where, <br>
                the connections are. In the event that the motherboard doesn't have enough connectors for the fans, you'll <br>
                need a peripheral hub that will let multiple fans connect to in while only using one spot on the motherboard.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Congratulations, your fans are now installed

                the tray silver side up, connections to the back. Anchor the drive in place with some screws and put it back into <br>
                the drive bay. Then use an SATA cable, which was provided with the motherboard, to connect the drive to the motherboard. <br>
                Then take a power connector from the PSU and plug it into the drive. Repeat for every drive you have.</li>
